# Automate Image Resizer
In an endeavor to make it easier to generate multiple image sizes and webp images, I decided to write this tool to handle this process automatically.
When trying to serve the proper images for websites I am designing, I always find it annoying to generate the proper image sizes, and the webp format images.

## What does it do?
- Resizes images to 25%, 50%, and 75% of the original size.
- Creates a webp format of each image.

## To Do
- Add extension selector.
- GUI optimizations.
